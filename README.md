## 1. Overview

This replication report reproduces the linear regression analysis predicting **life satisfaction** from **Aboriginal identity, sex, and marital status** using data from the **2017 Canadian General Social Survey (Cycle 31 ‚Äì Family)**.

The replication was based on a **master R script** provided by the author; no separate modular program file was included. The analysis was reproduced by following the master script‚Äôs annotations, replicating each data cleaning, modeling, and output step.

All numerical results were successfully reproduced. However, a minor methodological issue was identified ‚Äî the marital status variable (`MARSTAT`) was treated as **numeric** rather than **categorical**, resulting in a conceptually invalid specification despite computational reproducibility.

## 3. Data Description

**Data Source:**  
Statistics Canada, *General Social Survey (GSS) 2017 ‚Äì Family, Cycle 31*.  
File name: `gss-12M0025-E-2017-c-31_F1.csv`  

**Access:**  
Data were retrieved from the **CAnD3 online learning portal**.  
This dataset contains publicly available variables on social and family characteristics for Canadian respondents aged 15+.

**Variables Used:**

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| `SLM_01` | Self-rated life satisfaction (0‚Äì10) | Treated as continuous |
| `AMB_01` | Aboriginal identity (1 = Yes, 2 = No) | Recoded as factor |
| `SEX` | Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female) | Recoded as factor |
| `MARSTAT` | Marital status (1‚Äì6) | Treated as numeric in original; should be factor-coded |

## 4. Replication Steps

1. Imported raw data using `read.csv()`.  
2. Subsetted required variables (`SLM_01`, `AMB_01`, `SEX`, `MARSTAT`).  
3. Renamed variables (`feeling_lf`, `aboriginal_id`, `SEX`, `MARSTAT`).  
4. Filtered invalid or missing codes.  
5. Generated descriptive statistics (`skim()` and `tbl_summary()`).  
6. Fit linear regression model:  
   ```r
   lm(feeling_lf ~ aboriginal_id + SEX + MARSTAT, data = gss_clean)
